Our website was developed for an imaginary IT company called JKL Tech to advertise job positions, allow users to apply, and manage submitted application records. The website includes a home page, a page for our group details, a page outlining the job positions, a page to apply, and a page detailing the enhancement features implemented in the website. A manager can also log in to access the management page displaying all EOI records.
